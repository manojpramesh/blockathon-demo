## Introduction

Blockchain technology is a revolution in systems of record. The idea of blockchain technology can now be applied to any need for a trustworthy record. Blockchain serves as a ledger that is incorruptible, transparent, and bypasses censorship. By tackling issues of financial, political and institutional corruption, this has the potential to create massive social change and greatly protect the human rights of every individual.

For this particular project, we are trying to solve issues related to migrant workers. Blockchain can help save the lives of millions of migrant workers by solving some of the critical problems they face.
